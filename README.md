## ✨ Features

### 📊 Dashboard Overview
- Interactive KPI cards: Total Income, Total Expense, Current Balance, Daily Average Expense  
- Comparison analytics (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Income & Expense summary boxes with visual charts  
- Trend visualizations (Line, Bar, Pie, and Yearly charts)

### 💵 Income Management
- View and filter all income records  
- Add, edit, or delete income (frontend dummy mode)  
- Summary chart by month or category  

### 💸 Expense Management
- View and filter all expenses  
- Add, edit, or delete expenses (frontend dummy mode)  
- Expense breakdown by category and time period  

### 🤖 AI Chatbot (Finance Assistant)
A smart finance chatbot that helps analyze financial performance using natural language queries such as:
- “What’s my total income this month?”
- “Which category has the highest spending?”
- “How much did I spend on food this week?”
- “Compare my spending with last month.”

### 👤 Single User Mode
Each user (e.g., a family member or business owner) registers individually.  
The system is **not multi-user shared**, but instead designed for **personal or private use** — e.g., one dashboard per person or household.
